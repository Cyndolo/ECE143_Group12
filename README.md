We are using the folliwing third party modules:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- sklean
- xboost
- importos
- statsmodels.api
- scipy.stats

There are 5 separate Python files that each produce different charts:
1) yuxin_code.py
2) MBA_analysis_Henson_Le.py
3) haochen.py
4) .
5) .

yuxin_code.py:
fdfdfdf

MBA_analysis_Henson_Le.py:
- This file generates three spider/radar charts displaying the distribution of work industries each major in the dataset.
- The file also generates a heatmap showing combinations of majors and work industries and their corresponding admittance rates.
- All you have to do is make sure the filename called by "file_path" matches your file name.
- Click run and your charts should be generated!

haochen.py:
- Generates Violin plots for gender-conditional distributions of GPA, GMAT and work experience
- Generates Violin plots for race-conditional distributions of GPA, GMAT and work experience
- Generates histograms for gender-conditional admission counts and rates
- Generates histograms for race-conditional admission counts and rates
- Generates GPA vs. GMAT linear model plot, and its associated residal plot and GMAT-conditional GPA variance plot.
